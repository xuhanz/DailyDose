# Description
Daily Dose is a journaling app with an emphasis on ease of use and trend analysis. It pings the user a few times a day to check in with them and collect quick user-inputted data, most notably how they are feeling on a scale from 1-10 and what they are currently doing; this data is then compiled and visualized to show the user the trends of what affects their mood the most.
