# Agenda
In week 5 meeting, we plan to
- get feedback from project manager on the living document and revise the document afterwards
- get advice on CI choice, and what kind of example tests we could write for now
- ask about how to test our front end

# Team Report

## Plans and goals last week
- Environment setup (Android studio & probably emulator) 
- Get used to the technologies
- Begin coding; first task to implement most likely the entry and tags

## Current progress and issues
Finished up most parts of architecture and design<br>
Android Studio installed<br>

## Plans and goals for next week
- Add test-automation and CI to the test plan in the living document
- Continue revising other parts of the living document
- Start coding 

## Member Reports:
#### Matt:
1. Plans and goals last week:<br>
Set up development environment (Android Studio)<br>
Start coding! First order of business is the entry and tags page<br>
2. Current progress and issues:<br>
No code yet :(<br>
Android Studio installed, waiting on appropriate time to begin coding<br>
Extended living document with information on architecture and design<br>
Still some uncertainty and disagreement on specificity of design, and whether what we have is sufficient<br>
3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
Determine appropriate automated testing and integration scheme<br>
Further clarification and feedback on design and what we need<br>
Look into tutorials for Android Studio to prepare for coding<br>

#### Sherry:
1. Plans and goals last week:<br>
Setup Android studio and learn the basic mechanism of it<br>
Start experimenting with the interface; focus on the entry page<br>
2. Current progress and issues:<br>
Android Studio installed and set up, haven’t started coding yet<br>
Working on the architecture and design doc<br>
Looking for tutorials on Android Studio<br>
Looking for existing structures/frameworks in Android Design<br>
No issue at the moment
3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
Continue to familiarize myself with Android Studio<br>
Start experimenting with the interface and the frontend-backend interaction<br>


#### Ester:
1. Plans of last week:<br>
getting started on familiarizing myself with Android Studio<br>
learning the basics of Android mobile app development<br>

2. Progress & Issues:<br>
In week 4, I set up Android Studio and began looking at tutorials on how to create an Android app. I also contributed to editing the requirements documents and discussed with my teammates about the software architecture and design. <br> 

3. Plans for next week:<br>
I will continue to familiarize myself with using Android Studio to develop a mobile app, hopefully acknowledge the key concepts and techniques that will be useful and helpful to our project. Meanwhile, I will also try to come up with ideas of potential example tests for our app. 

#### Hunter:
1. Plans of last week:<br>
 I will reinstall and hopefully fix my Android Studio (I have been having issues with it crashing).<br>
I also plan to attend our group meetings and come to a consensus on what other technologies (if any) we need to use.<br>
2. Current Progress & Issues:<br>
In week 4, I reinstalled my Android Studio and went through hours of troubleshooting with a TA from an Android Studio - centric class. This made it at least workable. I also read some documentation and got a clearer idea of event-driven “on-click” functions for our frontend/backend interface. In terms of the assignment, I contributed to the updating of our living document as well as discussing our plan for implementation in more detail. <br>
I have continuing issues with my Android Studio app stemming from my use of a new M1 Mac.<br>
3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
This coming week, I will help my team decide which testing service to use. Once we have that nailed down I will brainstorm some specific ways to test our application.<br>
I also plan to gain more familiarity with the way frontend and backend interface within an android application. At that point we should be ready to get coding, at least a shell of our application.
