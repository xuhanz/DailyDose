## Current progress and issues
This week, we made progress fixing bugs in our application. We fixed an issue with the progress number not updating on edits, fixed another issue with the datepicker not accurately reflecting the current selection, and changed the menu to be a hamburger button instead of 3 dots. <br>
We did not encounter any issues this week. <br>

## Plans and goals for next week

Implemented the edit button on Entry Log page<br>
Fixed the position of the title bar in Entry Log Page<br>
Implemented the custom tag feature<br>
Helped resolve some issues for the tag analysis page<br>
Issues:<br>
I think in the weeks left, I will ensure that I always post updates about my work progress on the slack channel besides writing commit messages to GitHub. Doing this will avoid causing confusion between team members about what part is implemented, what issues are resolved, etc. This week there were members that accidentally worked on the same thing and did not acknowledge it until the last moment, which I felt was a pity so I really want to avoid it in the future. <br>
3. Plans for next week:<br>
In week 8, I will <br>
Continue adding more features to the app<br>
Add more comments to our code and look for possible refactoring of code to make our code follow good code style and guidelines<br>
Continue improving the design, usability, and style of our app<br>

I will continue to work to add features and iron out bugs in our app. In addition to that, I will complete the peer review I am assigned.<br>
2. Current Progress & Issues:<br>
This past week, I completed the peer review I was assigned. I also worked with Ester to fix the issue we were having with the progress number not updating on edits. In addition to that, we changed the menu icon to a hamburger button and fixed the issue of the datePickers not being updated to reflect the current selections. <br>
I did not encounter any issues this week.<br>
3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
This coming week, I will help plan and record our demo and group reflection, as well as doing all that I can to help make our project as complete as possible before final release on Tuesday. <br>
Specifically, I plan to work with Ester to add one last functionality to our tagging interface and make the tag options deletable.
