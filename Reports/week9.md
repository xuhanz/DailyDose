# Team Report

## Plans and goals last week
- Continue working on features of our app and ironing out bugs

## Current progress and issues
This week, we made progress fixing bugs in our application. We fixed an issue with the progress number not updating on edits, fixed another issue with the datepicker not accurately reflecting the current selection, and changed the menu to be a hamburger button instead of 3 dots. <br>
We did not encounter any issues this week. <br>

## Plans and goals for next week
- Next week, we will be working to finish adding features and fixing bugs in preparation for our final release. We will also record our demo and group reflection. 

## Member Reports:
#### Matt:
1. Plans and goals last week:<br>
Help iron out bugs in preparation for full release<br>
Begin working on user and developer documentation<br>
2. Current progress and issues:<br>
User and developer documentation completed for now<br>
Helped re-implement tests for JSON utility methods by making them integrated tests rather than unit tests<br>
3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
Help peer review other group’s projects<br>
Continue working towards full release<br>

#### Sherry:
1. Plans and goals last week:<br>
Implement the custom tags feature on tagging interface.<br>
Add date feature (whether read from system or from user input) and refactor our json file and utility class to better prepare for the tag analysis page.<br>
2. Current progress and issues:<br>
Implement the majority of TagAnalysis View (java and xml file), which generates trends on the selected tag. <br>
Handling calendar and utilizing packages from others is really a headache but luckily Tag Analysis has most of its functionality now.<br>
Issues:<br>
I’m not used to working with Github commit messages so I end up spending several hours working on the same thing as Hunter. I will read the whole commit message and check all the branches before working on my stuff.

3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
Refactor the average graph analysis page to display top rating tags and lowest rating tags in two separate graphs. <br>
Display the dates that the user has selected in the tag analysis view (instead of always displaying the date of “today”). <br>
Work on TagAnalysis Page to check redundancy in code and behavior in edge cases.<br>
Fix any issue that comes up. <br>
Merge the tag analysis branch after get it fully tested. <br>

#### Ester:
1. Plans of last week:<br>
Help with improving the usability of the app <br>
Develop a navigation bar that is easier to find and use. <br>
Help with further implementing the entry log page and trend analysis page. <br>
Implement the adding tags feature on the tag interface. <br>
Work on the overall style of the UI. <br>
2. Progress & Issues:<br>
Progress:<br>
Added numbers to the progress bar to display real-time progress <br>
Added date field to the Entry object and incorporated this in our app <br>
Implemented the edit button on Entry Log page<br>
Fixed the position of the title bar in Entry Log Page<br>
Implemented the custom tag feature<br>
Helped resolve some issues for the tag analysis page<br>
Issues:<br>
I think in the weeks left, I will ensure that I always post updates about my work progress on the slack channel besides writing commit messages to GitHub. Doing this will avoid causing confusion between team members about what part is implemented, what issues are resolved, etc. This week there were members that accidentally worked on the same thing and did not acknowledge it until the last moment, which I felt was a pity so I really want to avoid it in the future. <br>
3. Plans for next week:<br>
In week 8, I will <br>
Continue adding more features to the app<br>
Add more comments to our code and look for possible refactoring of code to make our code follow good code style and guidelines<br>
Continue improving the design, usability, and style of our app<br>


#### Hunter:
1. Plans of last week:<br>
I will continue to work to add features and iron out bugs in our app. In addition to that, I will complete the peer review I am assigned.<br>
2. Current Progress & Issues:<br>
This past week, I completed the peer review I was assigned. I also worked with Ester to fix the issue we were having with the progress number not updating on edits. In addition to that, we changed the menu icon to a hamburger button and fixed the issue of the datePickers not being updated to reflect the current selections. <br>
I did not encounter any issues this week.<br>
3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
This coming week, I will help plan and record our demo and group reflection, as well as doing all that I can to help make our project as complete as possible before final release on Tuesday. <br>
Specifically, I plan to work with Ester to add one last functionality to our tagging interface and make the tag options deletable.
