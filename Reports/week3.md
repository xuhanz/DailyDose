#### Ester:
1. Plans of last week:<br>
Next week, I will be working on setting up the Git repository and setting up some resources for the project. I will also contribute to writing a README.md file for our Git repository.
2. Progress & Issues:<br>
In week 3, I contributed to modifying the requirement and policies assignment, and helped create the github repo and README file. I also jotted a low-fidelity prototype for my imagined app UI. I did not encounter any issues so far.  
3. Plans for next week:<br>
For this coming week, I will be working on getting started on familiarizing myself with Android Studio and learning the basics of Android mobile app development. Hopefully, I can nail down some basic elements of the UI and start working on the interface. 

#### Hunter:
1. Plans of last week:<br>
I will help formulate the layout and format of our repo and get it set up with my team in our meetings.
I also plan to think about and look more into the tools we will need to complete this project.
2. Current Progress & Issues:<br>
In week 3 in our meetings, I helped create and join the git repo as well as contributing to our effort to clean up our requirements document. We also came agreed on general UI structure. Outside of the meetings I thought about the UI and shared a rudimentary mock-up with my team members.
I did not have any problems or misunderstandings this week, however, I was travelling all weekend and was not able to think about or research our technological setup as much as I would have wanted
3. Plans and goals for next week:<br>
This coming week, I will reinstall and hopefully fix my Android Studio (I have been having issues with it crashing). <br>
I also plan to attend our group meetings and come to a consensus on what other technologies (if any) we need to use..
