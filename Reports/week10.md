This week, we changed several minor things about our application to address the feedback we got from the peer reviews (added tags to the entry log, made tags stay selected when editing, made AvgRatingGraph scroll vertically instead of horizontally, etc). We also fixed our documentation and recorded and turned in our final release video. <br>
We did not encounter any issues this week. <br>
